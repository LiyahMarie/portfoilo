<p>This is about Aaliyah. I like to play sports but my favorite sport is volleyball. I been playing volleyball since the 5th grade. Playing volleyall was one of the hardest things in my life because I had nevered played volleyball before so I didn't quite get the concept of it. Afterall I got the hang of it and continued to play. I graduated from the elementary shool called Lawndale Community Academy. I'm am now attending the highschool UIC College Prep. So far in this program girls who code I have created programs.For example, paddle ball, ombamicon, drawing shapes python, and functions of python.
